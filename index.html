<p> Gambler's Fallacy Description: Our explorable creation explained the gambler’s fallacy with interactive elements and simulations the user could play.
We developed a web application to allow users to interact with multiple educational modules to learn about the gambler’s
fallacy. We used Javascript classes and loops to create a mini-game for the user to bet and wager on coin flips. We also used CSS
to style a flipping coin and create a button dashboard, as well as display a live graph of balance over time. We developed
simulations to show values of different random gambling strategies over time with Javascript loops, as well as
simulations where the user could create their own strategy by adjusting different variables and see its success over
time. Created using HTML/Javascript/CSS in an ObservableHQ notebook. Code: https://observablehq.com/@tmenezes1/gamblers-fallacy-3
  
<p> E-Commerce Auction Site Description: I developed a web application with HTML forms for registration, login, item post, and item bid. I handled form input
with PHP to write to a mySQL database with tables for users, items, interactions, and transactions, and displayed data
on an HTML webpage which included the list of items for sale, the current bid price, and time until expiration of sale.
Using PHP sessions, I displayed a user’s current balance after login and wrote to their specific entry in the database
after each transaction. I developed this web application e-commerce site with bidding functionality using HTML,
Javascript, CSS, PHP, SQL, and a mySQL database to manage users, items, interactions, and transactions.
